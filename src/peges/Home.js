      he tetracycline antibiotics block microbial translation
      and constitute an important group of antimicrobial agents
      that find broad clinical utility. Resistance to this class
      of antibiotics is primarily the result of active efflux or r
      ibosomal protection; however, a novel mechanism of resistance
      has been reported to be oxygen-dependent destruction of the dru
      gs catalyzed by the enzyme TetX. Paradoxically, the tetX genes have
      been identified on transposable elements found in anaerobic bacteri
      a of the genus Bacteroides. Overexpression of recombinant TetX in Es
      cherichia coli followed by protein purification revealed a stoichiom
      etric complex with flavin adenine dinucleotide. Reconstitution of in v itro
      enzyme activity demonstrated a broad tetracycline antibiotic spectrum and a req
      irement for molecular oxygen and NADPH in antibiotic degradation. The t
      tracycline products of TetX activity were unstable at neutral pH,
      but mass spectral and NMR characterization under acidic conditions
      supported initial monohydroxylation at position 11a followed by
      intramolecular cyclization and non-enzymatic breakdown to other
      undefined products. TetX is therefore a FAD-dependent monooxygen
      ase. The enzyme not only catalyzed efficient degradation of a br
      oad range of tetracycline analogues but also conferred resistanc
      e to these antibiotics in vivo. This is the first molecular
      of an antibiotic-inactivating monooxygenase, the origins of whic
      h may lie in environmental bacteria.
